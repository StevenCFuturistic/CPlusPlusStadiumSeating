Exercise #2 Stadium Seating 
There are three seating categories at a stadium.  For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15,
Class B cost $12 and Class C cost $9.  Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold,
then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.  Format your dollar amount in a fixed-point notation with two decimal
points and make sure the decimal point is always displayed.
